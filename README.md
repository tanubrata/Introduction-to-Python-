# CSCI_127

This is the CSCI 12700 course of Spring 2018 at Hunter College taught by Prof. St. John.
This was a pretty straightforward course and most of the lab works and homeworks 
have been uploaded here. Use it as a reference. These are solely for educational purposes.
Do not forget to mention in credits because a lot of dedication and hard effort was needed 
to do it.
